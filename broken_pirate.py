# Added a double quote after the statement ended
greeting = input("Hello, possible pirate! What's the password?")
# replaced the round bracket with a square bracket
if greeting in ["Arrr!"]:
    print("Go away, pirate.")
# replaced the elif statement with an else statement
else:
    # indented the line of code correctly
    print("Greetings, hater of pirates!")
